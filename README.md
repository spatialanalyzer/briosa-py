# Briosa Python clients

[Documentation](https://briosa.dev/) | [API Reference](https://briosa.dev/api/python) | [First MP Command](https://briosa.dev/docs/getting-started/first-request)

Independent exact-target clients for the [Briosa SpatialAnalyzer bridge](https://github.com/spatialanalyzer/briosa).

| SpatialAnalyzer target | Product and development guide | Client version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024.1.0508.5 | [SA 2024](targets/2024.1.0508.5/README.md) | 0.2.0 |
| 2026.1.0529.7 | [SA 2026](targets/2026.1.0529.7/README.md) | 0.2.0 |

Choose the package for your exact SA installation. Each product pins its own
generation artifact and retains Server 0.6.1 as a tested conformance baseline.
The 0.2 client line selects side-by-side servers using behavioral contract 1.0. Client package versions
are independent of the Briosa server version. See [Releasing](RELEASING.md) for
registry publishing and validation.

Package names include the SA target; application namespaces/imports remain stable.
See each product guide for installation and examples. Run development commands
from the chosen `targets/<exact-sa-release>/` directory. CI validates both products.

SpatialAnalyzer, its SDK, and a license are required separately for real work.
Portable checks do not establish licensed runtime validation. Broader licensed
runtime CI and enterprise Artifactory verification remain outstanding before v1.0
promotion.
